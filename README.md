"# Release_colab_tool" 

Refreshing django - vue fullstack skills

I am not sure if there is non-CICD environment but for us who are working under these conditions major version releases are always busy periods.
Colaborating among teams can be challenging especially spreading the word about new bug reports and solutions, new or reoccuring cases.

We could open for Teams or Zoom channels for each of them but these tools were not developed to cover these needs.

The aim is to create a forum like appication where support teams can share their knowledge to work in a more efficient way during this period.
